# Charter

The purpose of the MPI-5 ABI Working Group is to discuss and implement the features 
required for MPI binaries - applications and libraries - to work with any implementation
of MPI on compatible platforms.

This includes but is not strictly limited to defining an Application Binary Interface (ABI)
corresponding to MPI handles, constants, functions, etc.
It also includes the topic of launchers (i.e. `mpirun` and `mpiexec`), although this problem
is largely independent of the ABI issue itself (and is already solved by launchers like `srun`).

The chairs of the working group are Jeff Hammond and Quincey Koziol.
